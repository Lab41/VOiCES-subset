# VOiCES
Voices Obscured in Complex Environmental Setting ([VOiCES](https://voices18.github.io/)) is an open source audio corpus put together by Lab41 and SRI International. This dataset provides audio data recorded in real acoustically challenging reverberant environments. The foreground speaker is replayed speech from Libri Speech, and distractor noise, played simulataneously was taken from MUSAN. Data is recorded in real rooms, providing recording of real reverb and additional background noise (HVAC systems, flourecent light humming, people walking outside room, etc.). For more information visit [VOiCES](https://voices18.github.io/) official site, where you can find information on how to download the full dataset. 

This repo hosts a subset of the data where the main foreground speaker is at the 90 degree position. We also include a data file that has extracted spectral features.
